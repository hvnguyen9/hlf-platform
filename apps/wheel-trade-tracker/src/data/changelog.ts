    version: "v2.18.0",
    highlights: [
      "Stock lot detail page got a major upgrade — five fixes and additions across covered calls, share averaging, alerts, and notes.",
      "Add Shares to an existing lot — buy more shares into a position you already hold and the average cost is recomputed for you. Useful for averaging down on a dip without losing the lot's history.",
      "Cash-secured puts that get assigned now merge into the open lot for that ticker instead of creating a separate fragmented position. The new shares are weighted-averaged into the existing avg cost.",
      "New 'Effective / Share' stat shows your true cost basis after subtracting CSP premiums collected while you've been holding the lot. Sits next to your normal Avg Cost (tax basis) so you can see both — accounting basis vs. trader's running profitability.",
      "Lot price alerts — set a trigger directly on a stock lot for when it dips a chosen % below your avg cost, rises a chosen % above, or crosses an exact price you specify. Toasts fire the same way trade and watchlist alerts do.",
      "Notes can now be added or edited on any of your stock lots — used to be admin-only. Inline editor with auto-saving timestamps for share adds and CSP merges.",
      "Bug fix: when selling a covered call against a stock lot, the contract picker now correctly subtracts CCs already open against that lot. Previously it always offered the full lot capacity, making it possible to over-cover.",
    ],
  },
  {
    date: "2026-05-14",
    version: "v2.17.1",
    highlights: [
      "Speed pass across the app. The All Accounts dashboard, watchlist, and budget summary all load noticeably faster.",
      "Watchlist is lighter and smoother to scroll, especially on mobile.",
      "Alerts background updates are now gentler when you have multiple tabs open — less work in the background, same near-realtime feel.",
    ],
  },
  {
    date: "2026-05-14",
    version: "v2.17.0",
    highlights: [
      "Watchlist prices now stick at the previous trading day's close after the market closes, instead of constantly updating on stray after-hours ticks. Switches back to live prices automatically when the market opens — the same way Yahoo Finance handles it.",
    ],
  },
  {
    date: "2026-05-13",
    version: "v2.16.0",
    highlights: [
      "New Alerts feature — set price-triggered alerts on any of your open trades or watchlist tickers and get notified the moment a threshold fires. Replaces the separate Stock Alerts app, which has been retired.",
      "On each open trade, add Profit Target, Assignment Risk, and Roll Opportunity alerts with your own thresholds. Configure them inline right on the trade detail page.",
      "On each watchlist row, click the bell to set a price trigger — get notified when a ticker drops to your entry zone or breaks above a level you're watching.",
      "Alerts surface as a notification inside the app within seconds. If you're working in another tab, the browser tab title flashes with a counter so you know to come back and look.",
      "New Alerts page in the sidebar — one place to see every active trigger, toggle them on or off, delete them, or jump straight to the related trade.",

    date: "2026-05-09",
    version: "v2.15.0",
    highlights: [
      "Unified sign-in across the HLF suite — your account now lives in a single shared auth database, so the same username and password work in Wheel Tracker, Bookkeeping, and Budget Tracker. Profile and password changes made in any app update everywhere.",
      "Single sign-on across subdomains — signing into one HLF app signs you in to all of them automatically (production only; localhost dev still uses per-app cookies).",
      "Behind the scenes: dropped the local User table and its three foreign keys in favor of opaque userId references to the shared auth DB. Admin user list and delete were rewritten to span both databases.",
    ],
  },
  {
    date: "2026-05-08",
    version: "v2.14.2",
    highlights: [
      "Moved to the HLF Platform monorepo — all three HLF apps now live in a single codebase, share a common component library, and deploy from one place. No changes to features or data.",
    ],
  },
  {
    date: "2026-05-07",
    version: "v2.14.1",

  {
    date: "2026-05-07",
    version: "v2.14.0",
    highlights: [
      "HLF Platform foundation — Wheel Tracker now serves as the data source for the broader HLF suite. Bookkeeping can pull your trading P&L directly, and the Alerts app can read your open positions, so data stays in sync across tools without manual entry.",

  {
    date: "2026-05-01",
    version: "v2.13.2",
    highlights: [
      "Fix: stock realized gains now count on the dashboard — sold stock positions were missing from the 7D, MTD, YTD, and All-time P&L totals. The overview and all chart series now include P&L from fully closed stock lots alongside option premiums.",
    ],
  },
  {
    date: "2026-04-29",
    version: "v2.13.1",
    highlights: [
      "Auto-fill stock entry price — when adding a trade, typing a valid ticker now automatically fetches the current market price and pre-populates the Stock Entry Price field. The field stays fully editable; editing it manually stops any further auto-fill so your input is never overridden.",

      "Trade Journal — a new Journal page (sidebar nav) gives you a monthly calendar view of all closed trade activity. Days with trades are color-coded green or red by net P/L; click any day to see the individual trades. Each month has a free-form notes area that auto-saves as you type — capture market conditions, lessons learned, and trade decisions you'd revisit.",
      "Journal portfolio filter — when you have multiple portfolios, pill buttons let you scope the calendar and stats to a single portfolio or view everything together.",

      "Dashboard timeframe filter — the All Accounts summary now has 7D / MTD / YTD / All tabs. P&L, win rate, and realized gains update to the selected period while current-state metrics (capital deployed, cash available, open trades) stay fixed.",
      "Portfolio selector on the dashboard — when you have multiple portfolios, pill buttons appear so you can scope the timeframe view to a single portfolio without leaving the summary page.",
      "Activity tab redesign — the closed trades header now shows total P/L and average % P/L as color-coded badges, with a compact 7D / 30D / 1Y / All toggle replacing the old label-and-select layout.",
      "Allocation % consistency fix — the 'Capital In Use' figure on a trade detail page now uses the same denominator (current capital including profits) as the open trades table and the dashboard deployed % bar.",
      "Performance: the portfolio metrics API now issues date-filtered database queries for MTD and YTD period sums instead of loading your full trade history and filtering in JavaScript — faster for accounts with long trading histories.",
    ],
  },
  {
    date: "2026-04-26",
    version: "v2.11.0",
    highlights: [
      "Performance: the Activity tab now loads only the current page of closed trades from the server instead of fetching your entire history upfront. Switching timeframes or pages makes a targeted request rather than filtering thousands of rows in the browser.",
      "Performance: added database indexes on Trade and StockLot for date-range queries, making closed-trade lookups significantly faster as your history grows.",
      "Performance: the closed trades report no longer issues one database query per portfolio — all portfolios are queried in a single round trip.",
      "Performance: all list API routes now request only the fields they actually display, reducing JSON payload size.",

      "Positions portfolio filter — when you have positions across multiple portfolios, a dropdown appears in the Positions section so you can filter to see only one portfolio at a time.",
      "Watchlist sparkline charts — each ticker now shows an intraday (5-minute) price chart for the current trading session, colored green or red based on the day's direction.",
      "Day Range added to the watchlist — shows where the current price sits between today's low and high, alongside the existing 52-week range.",

    version: "v2.9.1",
    highlights: [
      "Fixed a bug where assigning a covered call on a partial stock lot would incorrectly close the entire lot instead of only selling the shares covered by the contracts. For example, assigning a 4-contract CC on an 800-share lot now sells 400 shares and leaves the remaining 400 shares open.",

      "Partial covered calls from stock lot — the Sell Covered Call button now defaults to the max contracts for your share count but lets you choose any quantity, with an 'Up to N contracts' hint shown inline.",
      "Partial share sells on stock lots — the new Sell Shares modal lets you sell any number of shares from an open lot instead of forcing an all-or-nothing close. Shares covered by open covered calls are automatically blocked from sale and shown clearly in the modal.",
      "Combined CC close + share sell — when closing a covered call (expired worthless, manual buy-to-close, or partial), a new 'Also sell N shares at close' checkbox lets you sell the underlying shares in the same transaction. The share price pre-fills with the strike price and is editable. Share P&L is calculated using the lot's cost basis after the CC premium has already been applied.",
      "Open lots with accumulated realized P&L from partial sells now show a 'Realized P/L (partial)' stat card so you can see your running total even before the lot is fully closed.",

      "Portfolio capital management overhauled — deposits and withdrawals are now tracked as individual transactions with an amount, date, and optional note, replacing the single 'additional capital' field.",
      "Every deposit and withdrawal is logged in a persistent history with a running total of deposits, withdrawals, and net adjustment shown below the transaction list.",
      "Portfolio settings moved out of the main tab bar and into a slide-out drawer triggered by the gear icon in the portfolio header — keeps the tabs focused on viewing your positions and keeps destructive actions out of the main flow.",
      "Settings drawer covers portfolio name editing, all capital transaction management, notes, and the danger zone in one scrollable panel.",
      "All inputs in the settings panel now match the rest of the app — the date field uses the same Popover + Calendar picker used in trade forms, and text fields use the standard Input component with proper labels.",

      "Watchlist added — a dedicated page showing live prices for all your open positions alongside any tickers you manually track, so you never have to bounce between tabs.",
      "Positions are auto-populated from your open trades and stock lots grouped by ticker. Each position appears as a clickable chip showing the type badge, strike, expiry, contracts, OTM/ITM %, and the portfolio it belongs to — clicking goes straight to that trade or stock detail.",
      "My Watchlist lets you add any ticker with one-click removal. Tickers are validated against Yahoo Finance before being saved so invalid symbols are rejected upfront.",
      "Manual watchlist entries show price, day change, a 52-week range progress bar indicating where the current price sits between the yearly low and high, and today's volume — all refreshing automatically every 60 seconds.",
      "If a manually-tracked ticker also has an open position it's flagged with a Position badge so you can see the overlap at a glance.",
      "Watchlist is fully mobile-responsive — positions and watchlist entries collapse into readable card views on phones instead of overflowing horizontal tables.",

      "Admin gets its own dedicated /admin page with a tabbed layout, keeping user management completely separate from personal account settings.",
      "User management: admins can impersonate any user (amber banner shows who you're viewing with a one-click Exit), reset passwords directly, delete users and all their data with a confirmation step, and toggle admin access.",
      "Impersonation fully wires into the app — sidebar, dashboard, and all data routes switch to the target user's context instantly and revert cleanly on exit.",
      "Admin trade editing: a Shield/Edit button on any trade detail page lets admins correct any field — ticker, type, strike, contract price, expiry, contracts, and for closed trades: close price, premium captured, P&L, and close reason.",

      "Sidebar can now be collapsed to a slim icon rail, giving tables and charts full screen real estate on desktop. State persists across page loads.",
      "Sidebar controls reorganized for better usability — the collapse toggle lives in the header next to the app name, and theme/settings are now compact icon buttons at the bottom rather than full nav items.",

      "Removed the redundant info tooltip (ⓘ) from trade detail — the information it contained is already visible on the page.",
      "The Portfolios list page has been retired — it was largely redundant with the All Accounts dashboard and individual portfolio overviews. Navigating to /portfolios now redirects to the dashboard. The sidebar 'Portfolios' label remains as a section header with direct links to each portfolio below it.",

      "Portfolio detail is now fully tabbed: Overview (the full per-portfolio dashboard with KPIs, charts, and open positions), Positions (stock lots + open trades with open premium strip), Activity (closed trade log), and Report (filtered report view scoped to this portfolio).",
      "All Accounts page gains an Overview / Report tab of its own — the standalone Reports page is retired and now lives inside the dashboard, eliminating the redundant nav item.",
