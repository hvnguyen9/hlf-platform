## Structure

```
apps/
  portal/                Signed-in landing page — cross-app KPI dashboard + profile + admin
  wheel-strat-tracker/   Options wheel strategy tracker (hub — data source for suite)
  hlf-bookkeeping/       Finance & trading P&L bookkeeping
  hlf-budgettracker/     Monthly budget tracker + FIRE dashboard
  stock-alerts/          Stock ticker alert system (own DB; daily cron at 5pm ET Mon–Fri)

packages/
  auth-db/               Shared User Prisma schema + PrismaClient for auth DB

## Apps at a Glance

| App | Port | Brand | DB |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wheel-strat-tracker` | 3000 | Emerald | `ballast` Railway |
| `hlf-bookkeeping` | 3001 | Indigo | `turntable:21201` Railway |
| `hlf-budgettracker` | 3002 | Teal | `shuttle` Railway |
| `stock-alerts` | 3003 | Violet | own Railway (set `DATABASE_URL`) |
| `portal` | 3004 | HLF green | no DB — reads from `@hlf/auth-db` + cross-app internal APIs |

---

## Shared Packages

### `@hlf/auth-db`
Prisma client for the shared auth DB (`AUTH_DATABASE_URL`). Owns the `User` table —
the single source of truth for user identity across the HLF suite. All apps read
and write user records through this package; per-app DBs only store opaque
`userId` strings (no FK constraint).

```ts
import { authPrisma, sharedCookieConfig } from "@hlf/auth-db"
import type { User } from "@hlf/auth-db"
```

`sharedCookieConfig()` — drop into NextAuth `cookies` to enable cross-subdomain
SSO. Returns a config that scopes the session cookie to `.hlfinancialstrategies.com`
in production; returns `undefined` in dev so localhost cookies stay host-only.

Migration: `pnpm --filter @hlf/auth-db db:migrate`

### `@hlf/ui`
Shared shadcn/ui components. New York theme, slate base, Tailwind CSS v4.
Apps import from here instead of duplicating components.

### `@hlf/typescript-config`
- `base.json` — strict TypeScript for library packages
- `nextjs.json` — Next.js apps (ESNext + Bundler resolution)
- `react-library.json` — React component libraries

---

## Cross-app Integration

All apps' internal APIs are guarded by the same `INTERNAL_API_KEY` bearer.

**wheel-strat-tracker** exposes `/api/internal/v1/`:

| Endpoint | Consumer |
|---|---|
| `GET /open-positions?email=` | hlf-wheel-alerts |
| `GET /closed-trades?userId=&from=&to=&portfolioIds=` | hlf-bookkeeping |
| `GET /portfolios?userId=` | hlf-bookkeeping |
| `GET /watchlist?email=` | hlf-wheel-alerts (future) |
| `GET /portal-summary?email=` | portal |
| `GET /trading-summary?userId=&from=&to=` | hlf-bookkeeping |

**hlf-bookkeeping**, **hlf-budgettracker**, **stock-alerts** each expose
`GET /api/internal/v1/portal-summary?email=` — consumed by the portal dashboard
to render the KPI strip and alerts inbox.

## Auth — sign-in identifier

Every app's `CredentialsProvider` takes an `identifier` field that accepts
either a username or an email. If the input contains `@` it's treated as email
(lower-cased before lookup); otherwise it's looked up by username. Same User row
in `@hlf/auth-db` either way.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_DATABASE_URL` | All HLF apps | Shared auth DB — `@hlf/auth-db`. Required by every app. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Per-app | Each app's own Railway DB |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | All HLF apps | **Must be identical** for cross-app JWT validity |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | All HLF apps | Drives `sharedCookieConfig()` — must start with `https://` in prod for SSO cookie to be issued |
| `INTERNAL_API_KEY` | wheel-tracker + consumers | Bearer token for internal API |
| `WHEEL_TRACKER_URL` | bookkeeping, stock-alerts, portal | Base URL for internal API calls |
| `BOOKKEEPING_URL` / `BUDGET_TRACKER_URL` / `STOCK_ALERTS_URL` | portal | Server-side base URLs for `portal-summary` calls |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_*_URL` (same four) | portal | Client-side launcher links — must be literal `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` access |
| `ALPACA_API_KEY` / `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` | stock-alerts | Alpaca market data |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | stock-alerts | Claude Haiku for alert messages (optional) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` / `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | stock-alerts | Email delivery |
| `CRON_SECRET` | stock-alerts | Bearer token Vercel cron sends to `/api/cron/daily` |
